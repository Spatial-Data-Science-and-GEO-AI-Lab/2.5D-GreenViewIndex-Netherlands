# Progress 

| Week | Progress |
| ---- | -------- |
| Week 1 | 
  - read relevant literature
  - two relevant papers, among others: 
    1. Modelling and mapping eye-level greenness visibility exposure using multi-source data at high spatial resolutions by S.M. Labib, Jonny J. Huck, Sarah Lindley 
    2. Viewshed-based modelling of visual exposure to urban greenery â€“ An efficient GIS tool for practical planning applications 
| Week 2 | 
  - familiarized myself with the calculation of viewshed analysis, decay model, GVI, among others
  - coded viewshed using python for Utrecht area
  - duplicated the code using R 
| Week 3 | 
  - switched to a sample of Amsterdam area due to missing data around Utrecht
  - created a mask of Amsterdam streets to exclude points outside of street network from the analysis
  - used Labib's function to run the gvi on a small part of Amsterdam 
    - To be done: 
      - create a mask for buildings instead of streets and duplicate the analysis
      - duplicate the gvi in R
      - use parallelization to run the analysis for the entire Amsterdam area
