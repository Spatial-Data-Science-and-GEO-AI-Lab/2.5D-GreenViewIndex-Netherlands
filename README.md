## Progress

| Week | Progress |
| ---- | -------- |
| Week 1 | - read relevant literature <br> - two relevant papers, among others: <br> 1) Modelling and mapping eye-level greenness visibility exposure using multi-source data at high spatial resolutions by S.M. Labib, Jonny J. Huck, Sarah Lindley <br> 2) Viewshed-based modelling of visual exposure to urban greenery â€“ An efficient GIS tool for practical planning applications by Zofie Cimburova, Stefan Blumentrath |
| Week 2 | - familiarized myself with the calculation of viewshed analysis, decay model, GVI, among others <br> - coded viewshed using python for Utrecht area <br> - duplicated the code using R|
| Week 3 |  - switched to a sample of Amsterdam area due to missing data around Utrecht <br> - created a mask of Amsterdam streets to exclude points outside of street network from the analysis <br> - used Labib's function to run the GVI on a small part of Amsterdam <br> - replicate the GVI in R <br> - create a mask for buildings instead of streets and replicate the analysis <br> - collected income data on buurts (neighbourhoods) for the entire Netherlands from CBS <br> <br> - To be done: <br> - use parallelization to run the analysis for the entire Amsterdam area <br>
